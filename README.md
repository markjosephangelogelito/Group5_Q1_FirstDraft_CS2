# Problem Statement

  Mental health refers to a person's psychological, emotional, and social well-being; moreover, it affects how one can handle stress, interact with others, make decisions, think, feel, and behave in daily life. Many students face increasing levels of stress and other mental challenges, but proper support is still limited for them. The lack of proper support and accessible resources often results in the deterioration of their mental health, negatively impacting their academic performance, relationships, and overall well-being. Addressing this important issue will ensure that students will get the proper help, accessible resources, guidance, and support to maintain their mental health, whether it is in their personal or academic life.
  
# Problem Objectives: This algorithm aims toâ€¦

  Provide a safe, judgment-free community where students can share their concerns, questions, and experiences related to mental health.
  
  Encourage students to reflect on their well-being regularly and take preventive actions when needed.
  
  Ensure students receive timely care and guidance in maintaining their mental well-being through increasing the accessibility of mental health services.
  
  # Anonymous Q&A Forum:
  
  This feature would allow them to ask questions about what they can do to help themselves. This feature can also be used to share their experiences, seek advice, and connect with peers.

  # Interactive Self-Assessment Tools:
  
  These are self-assessment tools, such as questionnaires or surveys, designed to identify symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. Based on the results, students would receive personalized recommendations for relevant resources and support.

  # Appointment Scheduling and Reminders:
  
  This feature would allow students to schedule appointments. The system would send reminders to both the student and the provider, lowering the chances of missed appointments and ensuring that students receive timely care.
